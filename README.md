# ConTeXt Environments

This project aims to create environments that allow ConTeXt to directly typeset XML files.

## pandoc

Right now, only the `pandoc-xhtml.tex` environment is available. My aim is to have a method to typeset high–quality PDF documents with ConTeXt from HTML files generated by pandoc.

It is still *work in progress*. The main issue that I’m experiencing is the following: the manual—[Dealing with XML in ConTeXt MkIV](http://pragma-ade.com/show-man-44.htm)—is all Greek to me.

I have some experience with XML and ConTeXt MkIV. Only as an average user, not as a programer (I cannot code myself). The way ConTeXt deals with XML is totally new to me. I have to learn first how it works.

Of course, feel free to fork and send pull requests with patches or new code.

## Other environments

I’m also interested in creating an environment for TEΙ (at least to typeset [their Guidelines](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/)).
